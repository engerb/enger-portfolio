    A few things I do
        UX / UI design
        UX and logic flows, such as checkout, shipment tracking and other transactional flows. 
        Testing and iteration for increasing conversions.
        Creating web and native app comps and documentation for dev handoff. 
        Creating and maintaining design systems. 

        Physical product and CMF
        Prototypes using laser cutting and 3D printing, such as our rovers food storage.
        CMF including concepts, renders and final manufacturability. 
        Product packaging and out-of-box experience. 

        Dev work
        Web-dev work such as React for this website, the touch screen on our robot and Web-GL too. 
        Servers and signal processing in python, currently learning Tensor-flow.
        C / C++ on embedded systems as well as CUDA. 
        All helpful in building prototypes, some even work their way into our end products.

        Hello! Thanks for checking out my work! 

        I started out learning 3D modeling in 2005, making games and websites then. I wanted to get into the film or game industry so I went to school for 3D design in 2011, but ended up getting drawn down the path of product design. I'm always honing my craft, keeping up with the latest design trends, dev libraries and coolest hardware, but being able to connect the dots and build something people need is the most exciting part.

        I'm passionate in working on the most challenging and undefined products, with cool people. Right now that's the X team at Postmates building our robot product.

    Delivery robots?
        in 2018, our design team set out to make delivery robot interactions more intuitive and enjoyable. The landscape at that point was very undefined with robots that ranged from difficult to understand all the way to downright intimidating. 

        Product requirements
             • Friendly and approachable
             • Able to communicate intent
             • People should feel safe around it
             • Secure and hygienic
             • Recognizable, not just some robot

        Challenges
            "Robots are not there yet, I don't feel safe around one."
            "Scooters and other crap already litter the sidewalk, we don't need another thing!"

    Meet Serve
        After testing concepts through online surveys and cardboard models, we landed on Serve. Most people intuitively understood where the "front" was, its face, and how to interact with it. Now that we had our product's concept, we started work on detailing and designing all the interactions Serve may have with people.

        [ Concept of Serve ]


    The "sidewalk UI"
        Between picking up food at restaurants and dropping off the delivery, 95% of Serve's time is spent on sidewalks. We only get a few seconds between each pedestrian to make that interaction safe, understandable, and enjoyable. My goal was to express the Serves intentions through lights, sounds, and motion.

        Light design      
            For the eyes and strip, I soldered together a hardware prototype created the animations that run on the microcontroller.

            [ Video of Ai Chechni and serve eyes ]

        CSound design
            Conveying intent through sound can be difficult. I created a python script that converts the rovers speed into a modulated sound so that people would understand something is approaching from behind them, and how fast it is going.

            [ some fun apple that plays sounds? ]

        Motion design 
            I designed motion strategies that use 4 wheels and car like steering that better convey Serve's intent helping Serve navigate difficult situations and build trust with pedestrians.

    Transactional design: How to interact with Serve
        Most importantly, people need to get their food from Serve. I designed, tested and developed the touchscreen experience, that seamlessly combined with lights, sounds and lid actuation to create a low-friction experience that was well received by users. 

        [ some sizzle on the transactional flow, maybe a prototype ]


    Piloting UI
    Driving Serve
        Autonomous vehicles sometimes need help, especially when it's a sidewalk with no lanes. I designed a tele-ops interface that allows our fleet of Serves to be monitored by just a few people. Intervening and driving if necessary.

        [ Some comps of pilot-ui ]

    Hardware design
        Food storage in Serve
            I modeled various 3D designs and 3D prints that were tested against different food configurations. The one that tested best was the "2 cupholders and an offset pizza shelf" design. This allowed many order combinations to securely fit during deliveries. 

            [ some cool graphic on prototypes and fitting in different food items ]

        CMF - Serve's style
            To visualize ideas faster, I created a web tool that allowed us quickly explore new designs and if they fit our fun and approachable brand.

    Ever buy shoes online?
        It's scary stuff! Even the same size and fit varies between models in the same brand! In 2014, I joined up with the founders in a tiny Vancouver subleased office to tackle this very problem. Smartphones were getting more powerful by the year and our aim was to use computer vision to allow a user to measure their feet in their home and shop online with confidence. 

        We started by building this tech around our own insole product and other footwear, which was made custom with the help of 3D printing. Our main target would be early tech adopters, urban athletes and people between 30 to 60 years who work in professions that require them to stand on their feet seeking comfort — such as teachers or nurses.

        Product requirements
             • Easy to measure
             • Trustworthy
             • Accurate results
             • Provide comfort

        Challenges
            ...


    Measurement app
        The measurement app is a native iOS and Android app that allows users to take their measurements, learn about their feet as well as purchase our footwear customized to those measurements. 

        What photos to take?
        A hardware engineer, a bio-mechanics engineer, a computer mission engineer and I conducted a study with 500 people. We brought them into our office, measured their feet, took castings, 3D scans and asked them to take various photos with their phones that we thought would provide enough data to get measurements. 

        The only photos that we could rely on and have users easily take were a top photo of each foot, on a blank sheet of paper for scaling, and a side photo to capture their arch and other geometry.
